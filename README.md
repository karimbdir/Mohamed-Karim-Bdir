  <p>At Sales Ops, I served as a Data Analyst, where I assisted clients in scraping product data and integrating it into their WordPress sites. Additionally, I developed comprehensive financial plans.</p>

  <p>Currently, as a Corporate Controlling Data Analyst Specialist at COFICAB Group, I analyze and manage financial and operational KPIs for 17 plants worldwide, ensuring accurate and timely reporting. I developed a centralized hub for dashboards on SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) using Python for ETL and SQL. Additionally, I helped create a budgeting tool in SAC and am currently developing a costing tool and a pricing tool. During my first year as a Corporate Controlling Reporting Coordinator, I built several operational and financial templates using Excel to ensure prompt and efficient reporting.
